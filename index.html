        <h1>A PERSONAL BLOG</h1>
        <h3>What do I do, and what's in it for you?</h3>
        <br />
        <p>
          I have over 10+ years experience in IT operations, but the learning
          never stops. I have the hands-on, foundational skills necessary to
          work in my field, but I have yet to learn the specifics in the
          exicting field of cybersecurity and especially web penetration
          testing.
        </p>
        <p>
          With this blog I want to share my learning path, my knowledge, and my
          ideas with you. I'm getting out of my comfort zone and that is a good
          thing, I guess.
        </p>
        <p>
          So what should I focus on, and whatâ€™s the best way to get started?

            This is the place where all the theoretical learning happens. It's
            about having fun reading books (and watching YouTube videos) and to
            earn professional certificates. &#8250;

            The best and only way is to just do it! This section is about my
